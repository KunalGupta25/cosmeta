# Uploads Directory

This directory is used to store uploaded chapter cover images.

## Notes

- This directory must exist and be writable by the application
- Images uploaded here are referenced in the database
- When deploying to Vercel, you'll need to use a storage service like Supabase Storage or AWS S3 instead of local file storage
